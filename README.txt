EDIT: Just realised that my python script isn't an executable like how I'd like it to be. It'll have to be copied into a .py file and then turned into an executable...

To use:
line 7, in between the ''  type in your username.
line 8, in between the '' type in your password.
line 12, in between the '' type in the path to your LoL exe.

You may need to add a time delay for the time it takes for league to start. This can be implemented perhaps inbetween line 32 and 33 in the form of "time.sleep(1)" where the 1 represents one second. 

And I believe that is all. Let me know if this has been of any use! Free for anybody to use.
